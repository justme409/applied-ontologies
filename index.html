        <h1>Superintelligence for the job site.</h1>
        <p>Applied Ontologies is building the operating system for autonomous construction companies. Every stream of project intelligence stays synchronized in one command layer that moves work from briefing to ribbon cutting.</p>
        <p>Today our knowledge stack orchestrates every document, decision, and deliverable across two flagship verticals:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Project Pro</strong> — the general construction command center that models regulations, materials, crews, and schedules in a living ontology.</li>
          <li><strong>Project Engineer</strong> — the civil and infrastructure specialist that pairs design constraints with real-time site telemetry and robotics control.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The platform composes a living project graph to plan, simulate, and execute work. The roadmap is simple: scale capabilities fast, then graduate to fully autonomous, zero-headcount builders.</p>
