        <h1>Superintelligence for the job site.</h1>
        <p>Applied Ontologies is building the operating system for autonomous construction companies. We are a straight-shot lab focused on one product: safe, accountable superintelligence that can take a project from briefing to ribbon cutting.</p>
        <p>Today our knowledge stack orchestrates every document, decision, and deliverable across two flagship verticals:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Project Pro</strong> — the general construction command center that models regulations, materials, crews, and schedules in a living ontology.</li>
          <li><strong>Project Engineer</strong> — the civil and infrastructure specialist that pairs design constraints with real-time site telemetry and robotics control.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The platform composes a living project graph to plan, simulate, and execute work. The roadmap is simple: scale capabilities as fast as we can keep safety in front, then graduate to fully autonomous, zero-headcount builders.</p>

          <h3>Integrated Autonomy</h3>
          <p>Human-in-the-loop today, robotic crews tomorrow. We engineer for deterministic safety so machines can deliver without supervision.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h3>Graph-Native Governance</h3>
          <p>Every task, permit, and part is represented as linked knowledge. Compliance, QA, and scope control stay ahead of fieldwork.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h3>Fail-Fast Delivery</h3>
          <p>We push features straight into production projects, instrument everything, and learn faster than traditional firms can schedule stand-ups.</p>
